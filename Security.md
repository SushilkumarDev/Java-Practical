# Security Policy for Java-Practical

## Overview
The security of the **Java-Practical** repository and its users is of utmost importance. This document provides guidelines for reporting security vulnerabilities, handling sensitive information, and best practices for maintaining the security of the codebase.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository, please report it as soon as possible. Follow these steps to ensure your report is handled appropriately:

1. **Do not create a public issue**: To protect users and the integrity of the project, please refrain from posting sensitive information in public GitHub issues.

2. **Send a report via email**: Email your vulnerability report to [SushilkumarDev](mailto:sushilkumardeveloper@gmail.com) with the following information:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Any relevant screenshots or proof of concept
   - Severity level of the vulnerability (low, medium, high, critical)

3. **Confidentiality**: Your report will be treated confidentially. We will work to resolve the issue promptly and will keep you informed of our progress.

## Security Best Practices
To maintain the security of the **Java-Practical** repository, all contributors and users should follow these best practices:

- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly check for updates to any libraries or dependencies used in the project. Use tools like [Dependabot](https://github.com/features/automated-security-fixes) to automate this process where possible.

- **Code Reviews**: All pull requests should be reviewed by at least one other contributor to catch potential security issues.

- **Input Validation**: Ensure that all user input is validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and command injection.

- **Use Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) in environment variables rather than hardcoding them in the codebase.

- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to detect unauthorized access or anomalies in the application.

## Security Updates
Regular updates will be made to address known vulnerabilities. Contributors and users are encouraged to keep an eye on the repository's commit history and release notes for any security patches or updates.

## License
This security policy is part of the overall project and is subject to the same license as the rest of the repository. 

## Contact
For any security-related questions or concerns, please contact [SushilkumarDev](mailto:sushilkumardeveloper@gmail.com).
